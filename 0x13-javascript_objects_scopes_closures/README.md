##Javascript - Objects, Scope and Closures
#Objects
Object are used to organize data in a structured manner. they are created using curly braces `{}` and consist of key value pairs

#Scope
Scope refers to the environment(part of the program) to which variables, functions and objects are visible and accessible.

#Closures
This is a combination of a function and it lexical environment within which that function was declared. it allows a function to access variables and function from it outer scope. even after the function is done executing.
